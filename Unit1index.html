    <h2>Unit 1 outcome</h2>
    <h2>-	1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>

    <p>The main purpose of IT in modern business is convenience, a computer program will reduce the number of mistakes that would traditionally be made without IT. IT software and hardware don’t have the same limitations as humans. IT works consistently without becoming ‘tired’, something you’d see if someone did the work manually. Modern IT is used in every sector of business in every level, these areas include communication, organisation, productivity or research. All these areas of business are highly dependent on modern IT. Some other key roles of IT are data management systems, customer relationship management, inventory management systems and relationships between customers, employees and employers.

    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills, and, resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
      
     <p>You need a platform where you can plan and monitor the project with your team. This could be trello or another similar online platform that allows for multiple people to edit and update one or more pieces of work. Having the skill of working as part of a team and being able to work to deadlines vitally important to successful complete digital projects. Ares you should focus on are:</p>
     <p>-	Meeting briefed requirements </p>
     <p>-	Meeting deadlines </p>
     <p>-	Following budget guidelines </p>
     <p>-	Deliver on expected quality of project </p> 
      
      
    <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT -e.g. making your own website. How will you plan it? Include a link of your Trello board [2] </h2>

      <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail and why? [3] </h2>
      
      <p>There are many risks for digital projects, and I am going to describe the ones I consider to be why projects fail. Teams focusing too much on short term goals, this can make the overall project be neglected. When it comes to putting everything together, there wasn’t enough time spent on the long-term priorities due to all the time wasted on short term. Another reason companies’ digital projects fail is due to poor planning, this could be poor planning or just a poorly executed plan, but both have the same outcome, failure. Trying to do too much at one time can also damage your overall project, you must always be mindful of overloading your team. This is because a quality product takes time to produce perfectly if you rush it you will have a rushed produced. </p>
      
      
      <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
        <p> I would start by assessing what the requirements for the project. What I decide to use would be tailored to that project. For example, for a digital project, trello is a must to keep your team and project up to date on where everything is, what is going right and where you need to focus more on. But for other projects GITHUB might be a lot more useful for version control and it has its own project sections that is just like trello. I will usually find the software I know best and that I know is capable of the project.</p>
      
      
      <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes – How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h2>
     <p>Trello has helped me keep track of all more work, break it up into smaller tasks and do them one by one. This helped me because tasks are always easier if you break them down into small tasks, whereas if you just get a massive project thrown on you with no plan starting can be hard and your progress would be a lot slower than with a trello. Git and GitHub are great for version control. If you make an organisation you can invite collaborators and as you edit your project it will update the one on GitHub, as well as your collaborators. </p>
      
      
      <h2>1.7 Describe the legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDRP impact digital projects </h2>
      <p>GDPR is legislation put into place to protect people’s personal data. For example, if you go to a club that has an ID scanner that company is no longer allowed to keep your data for any longer than they have to. This is to combat the fact that people where abusing people personal data and selling it on to companies. But this does not just apply to bar and clubs, this applies to every company you share your details with. After a company has used your data for its purpose it must be destroyed. </p>
