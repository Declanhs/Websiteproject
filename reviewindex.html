<h1>Web Portfolio of Declan Heritage</h1>
<h2>This is my review of the project follows guidelines from outcome 2 and 3</h2>
<h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h1>
<p>I am happy with the tools I used during the process of making my website. I used Visual Studio Code, Trello, html and CSS. VSC is really useful with an extension called liver server you can run your html and CSS file in the browser to see a preview. This is really useful if you don’t have a domain name and want to see what you have coded. Trello is a useful tool for keeping track of work and planning ahead to make sure the project was done on time or before. </p>
<h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h1>
<p>The tools selected were appropriate, this is due to the fact they did the job intended for them. We needed visual studio code to code our html and CSS, and live server to host it to the browser. I used trello to plan the project by breaking it into small tasks like answer ‘unit 1 outcome 1’ or ‘add page project’. Each small task added up to a bigger task until the project was finished. </P>
<h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h1>
<p> When looking at my website with a more critical eye, I have to consider what I imagined and planned by website to look like and what the final product came out like. I wanted a website that was pleasant on the eye and easy to navigate. The navigation bar at the top clearly show what the contents of each page is and are easy to see. There is no need to go through multiple pages and is straightforward. I like the colours I chose, it shows the writing clearly, while also being easy on the eye. I like the minimalistic approach I took – where I didn’t need loud and obnoxious colours to make my website stand out. I wish I did have more content to put on the site – which would fulfil the purpose of the site. If I had more time, I would also change some of the aesthetics – trying to make the font more appealing as it looks to basic to me. </p>

<h1> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>
<p> Some improvements I could make increasing my content, right now there isn’t a lot of content which in the future I would look to expand on. I would decide on a theme for my website for example space, deserts or maybe ocean. This could also just be colour schemes I would use. I would also change the navigator bar with a 3d effect. I am planning on adding my terminal game onto the site but at the minute I am not sure how, so once I have figured that out, I will have it running on the site which is an improvement. </p> 

<h1>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h1>
<p> The outcome I wanted from this project was to have a site I could use as a resume, which also had the information request by Unit 1 and Unit 2 outcomes. My site fulfilled these criteria and fits the purpose of the project. This website has all the parts it needs from Unit 1, Unit 2, About me, Contacts, Projects, review and a Home page. I used Trello to ensure I met all the requirements. </p> 

    <h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h1>
    <p>Yes, I could have been more efficient making my website if I had the knowledge I have now when I started the project. I spent a lot of time trying to make a top navigator bar using my list through html style But this isn’t the correct way, what I had to do was make the display: flex. Which lists things in a straight line instead of down. You use this in CSS with a class attached to your list. Having a team would have made a huge difference because you can break it up into pages. You would still need to have the compatibility of the navigator bar and overall theme and colour scheme. I would do this by sharing any updates you do to the navigator bar with the team and discussing it together.  </p>
    <h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>
    <p>The way I would improve productivity and efficiency is by planning a careful strategy to break everything down into manageable parts, which in turn makes it more time efficient to piece all the parts together to create the final project. For example, if you have a website with multiple pages you could devise the pages by the number of people you have. Once you have this your team will get small tasks of what their page or pages need. Then you put it all together and should have a full functioning website in the fastest possible timeframe.  </p> 
    <h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack? </h1>
    <p>I would definitely attach my files to GitHub so I could have access to it anywhere, anyone form my organisation can change the work and you will be notified of changes which is really useful. I believe the GitHub tool is useful for group projects and project you take on solo. Working with a team will always make projects faster, it gives you a lot less responsibility personally and becomes a team effort. Slack is an amazing tool for working as part of a team, it allows you to show files, pictures, messages, you can even set alarms and reminders. Zoom is also a really effective tool to use to increase productivity. For example, if you struggling to get something to work and your team understand how, they can explain it to you on zoom and you can share your screen. This would allow your team to see the problem and self it a lot faster than trying alone.   </p>
    <h1> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h1>
    <p> There are many ways you can test digital solutions to make sure your website is suited for multiple browsers, devices and networks. Analytic software can be used to understand what devices and software is accessing a webpage - which can determine what and where your demographic is. Installing different browsers such as internet explorer, google chrome, Firefox and Safari to test how the website shows up on these different platforms. You can also use this method to test out zooming, copy/paste and page resizing. Network is something else you can test trying to use Wi-Fi, 4/5G networks and hotspots, you have to confirm these networks allow the site to work properly.  </p>
