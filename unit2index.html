      <h1>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h1>
<p>Home page – I have six pages in total. These all have the same theme running. A navigator bar with white writing and order. The title is my h1. Then a picture of me and another h1 to welcome viewer to my page. </p>
<p>About me – Has my h1 introducing the page, h2 introducing this about me and then start the about me. There is also a picture of me centred on this screen. </p>
<p>Projects – at the minute is pretty bare, but still has the Nav bar it also has h1. Which are projects by Declan heritage. H2 saying here you will soon see my projects. The reason I haven’t put any projects here is because I am not sure on the process of turning a python terminal game into a full self-working browser game. I expect this to change in the next few days to update the page further. </p>
<p>Unit 1 – this has the nav bar in the top left, h1 under it and h2 giving the questions and answered in paragraph sections. The question answer format of h1 and p continues until all the questions are answered and the page ends. </p>
<p>Unit 2 –this has the nav bar in the top left, h1 under it and h2 giving the questions and answered in paragraph sections. The question answer format of h1 and p continues until all the questions are answered and the page ends. </p>
<p>Contact – This page starts out with the nav bar followed after by a centred h1 that says contact. There is then a h2 that gives my email and says you can contact me by email… after this it goes back to h1 and states my name and country location. </p> 


<h1>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h1>
<p>You do not need to apply for copyright, copyright is automatic after creation if you sign your work or not. There is a system called Copyscape that will compare webpages and return any with matching text. Copyright means you need the right to copy someone else’s work and if you do not get this you can and probably will be sued a fairly decent amount of money.  Another thing to watch out for is GDPR this limits how long you can keep sometimes data and what you are gong to use it for. If you break GDPR you can get in a lot of trouble and be fined</p>

<h1>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h1>
<p> There are a fair few things that can be done to accommodate people with disabilities such as being visually impaired. For example, allowing enlarged text, be mindful of the colour, shortcuts to help navigation and allow desktop users to view site in mobile site. You could also enable a siri like text reader what can read text if you hover over it with the mouse, this would allow the person to know exactly what was going on.          </p>

<h1>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h1>
<p>The appropriate file  for a website are; jpeg for imagines, pdf which is just for a text document you can’t edit, mp4 is video and sound, and PNG is the filetype that is usually used for transparent image. A Jpeg is the type of file you would use to attach your images to a website </p>
